This folder contains python scripts which are used for grid-based analysis (i.e., not standwise)

Also, a copy of hypdatatools* is included. These tools are part of the spectralinvariant package
and are not regularly updated here. The copy here is given for convenience, to avoit a dependence on spectralinvariant.
